This module contains helper methods for making DAG reachability queries.

The methods are used by the 'Block' class for maintaining future blocks and answering reachability queries.

def insert_future_block(future_blocks, block):
	"""
	Inserts 'block' to 'future_blocks' list while keeping 'future_blocks' ordered by interval.
	If a block B âˆˆ future_blocks exists s.t. its interval contains block's interval, block need not be added.
	If block's interval contains B's interval, it replaces it.

	Notes:
		(1) Intervals never intersect unless one contains the other (this follows from the tree structure
			and the indexing rule).
		(2) Since 'future_blocks' list is kept ordered, a binary search can be used for insertion/queries.
		(3) Although reindexing may change a block's interval, the is-superset relation will by definition
			be always preserved.

	Tests if 'block' is in the subtree of any of 'future_blocks'.
